      <description>Weird title, eh? It should be because our body is weird, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Actually, it is not. I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you something interesting(I hope :p) about our human body in this blog. Our body is evolving since I don&amp;rsquo;t know maybe half a million years ago or even more than that. They say our body is a temple. Temple is where we worship and keep it clean all the time.</description>

      <description>Who created us? When I ask this question the very common answer I get is “Of course, God created us”. Damn it dude then who created the God in the first place? I mean wait, which God are we talking about? Since the evolution of humans, there have been thousands of Gods created by humans. Krishna, Titans, Jesus, Buddha didn’t we create them? but why? Why did we create them? Where did this idea of God come from?</description>
