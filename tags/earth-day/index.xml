      <description>It was 7.30 in the morning and I was still rolling on my bed trying to read my e-mails with one eye &amp;lsquo;cause my other eye is too lazy to open itself. My Alexa started her routine by telling a fact of the day and she wished me &amp;ldquo;Happy Earth day, dude!&amp;rdquo; My other eye opened now. It&amp;rsquo;s Earth day! We all love our earth, don&amp;rsquo;t we? We do. It&amp;rsquo;s just that we forgot long back or we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to show that love.</description>
